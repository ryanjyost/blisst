		  <h2>Terms of Use</h2>

		  <p>
			<strong>THE BASICS (sans legal jargon)</strong><br><br>

				Blisst is a place to share links to intersting things, all shared and/or curated by our users, editors and administrators. Given the freedom awarded to users, and inherent room for controversy, it is important that certain guidelines and rules govern this website and anyone who uses it.<br><br>

				Please read the Terms of Use (below) before using blisst.net. By continuing to use blisst.net, you consent to the conditions set forth in the Terms of Use and agree to abide by our <a href="http://localhost:8888/mumbling/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>. If you do not consent, then do not use this website.<br><br>

				Creation of an account with blisst.net, the contribution of any content to this website, including submitting a post, commenting, etc., and sharing any content found on this website constitutes a legally binding agreement to consent and comply to the conditions laid out in the Terms of Use, Code of Conduct and <a href="http://localhost:8888/mumbling/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.<br><br>

				POSTING ANONYMOUSLY DOES NOT, IN ANY WAY, IMPACT THE BELOW TERMS OF USE. AND THOUGH WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO KEEP ANONYMOUS POSTING TRULY ANONYMOUS, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE YOUR ANONYMITY.<br><br>

				DO NOT…<br>
				…plagiarize, i.e. take someone else’s intellectual property, original work, writing or ideas and misrepresent them as your own or someone else's.<br>
				…inaccurately cite a link, especially if it's flat out false. If we discover consistent faulty sharing of links and other media sources, we will ban your email.<br>
				…impersonate someone who is not you. Using real names as user names can get dicey pretty quickly, so we suggest just making your username something clever and unique.<br>
				…post illegal content or link to it.<br>
				…post threats, harassment “hate speech,” pornography of any kind, libel, defamation, etc.<br><br>

				If you do any of these things, or in any apparent way violate our Terms of Use or Code of Conduct, we will delete your account and any material associated with it. We reserve the right to remove content for any purpose, but we can’t imagine doing so unless the reason is blatantly in violation of anything laid out here or that undermines the integrity of the website. THAT BEING SAID, THIS IS NOT A “SAFE SPACE.”<br><br>
